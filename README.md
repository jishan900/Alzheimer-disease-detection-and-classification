# Alzheimer-disease-detection-and-classification

I implemented a deep learning algorithm for that project to identify four types of Alzheimer's disease problems. I pre-processed the dataset and split the whole dataset into training, testing, and validation portion. Using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimization technique, I achieved an excellent training and validation result.

Using Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset (128 x 128)

The Dataset is consists of total 6400 MRI images.
    
    Class - 1: Mild Demented (896 images)
    
    Class - 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)
    
    Class - 3: Non Demented (3200 images)
    
    Class - 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)
